# MockSchedule

MockSchedule is a scheduling system designed to help MBA students prepare for their placements by connecting them with mentors. The application includes a backend built with Node.js, Express, and SQLite, and a frontend developed using React.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:
- `frontend/`: Contains the React frontend code.
- `backend/`: Contains the Node.js backend code.

## Features

1. **Mentor Priority Scheduling**: Ensures that mentor availability is prioritized over student availability, scheduling back-to-back sessions when possible.
2. **Subject-Specific Mentorship**: Allows students to select mentors based on specific MBA placement preparation subjects or areas of expertise.
3. **Customizable Session Durations**: Students can choose session durations of 30, 45, or 60 minutes.
4. **Premium Mentorship**: Option for students to select specific mentors for an additional charge.
5. **Payment Integration**: Calculates costs based on session duration and mentor selection, with a simple payment confirmation page.
